## Business Requirements (BRD)

**Frame:** This platform exists to demonstrate real production-grade SRE
engineering capability — not to treat patients. Business value comes from
proving reliability, observability, controlled failure survival, and
architectural credibility at national-health-scale realism.

---

### Business Requirements (Flat, Hybrid Format)

**BR-01 — Demonstrate realistic national-scale healthcare workload simulation**  
The platform must simulate U.S.-style healthcare entities (patients,
providers, facilities, encounters, billing events) with enough fidelity to
meaningfully exercise SRE patterns under realistic load.

**BR-02 — Prove ability to safely operate under load without real PHI**  
All data must be fully synthetic, safe, and pseudonymized while still
behaving architecturally like real health data for observability, diagnosis,
and performance testing.

**BR-03 — Prove horizontal scalability without redesign**  
The system must scale from single-node to multi-node Kubernetes environments
with **no architectural changes** — only configuration and replica count
adjustments.

**BR-04 — Demonstrate shard-based routing and locality enforcement**  
The platform must prove that data is **partitioned and routed logically by
patient identity**, allowing realistic demonstration of affinity, locality,
and downstream load behavior.

**BR-05 — Demonstrate provable failure resilience**  
The system must **remain operational during arbitrary pod/replica failure** —
including SQL nodes — proving that it can self-heal without operator
intervention.

**BR-06 — Demonstrate full observability maturity (MELTP)**  
Every request must emit **Metrics, Events, Logs, Traces, and Profiles** —
correlated — with **zero orphan execution**, and fully visualizable in
Grafana.

**BR-07 — Prove auditable accountability for ALL state changes**  
Every write must be traceable to a **specific user_id and request_id**, fully
reconstructible via temporal tables plus audit events.

**BR-08 — Demonstrate multi-role security boundaries**  
The platform must support at minimum **3 application roles** (patient,
clinician, admin) with **enforced logical access separation** and a
guard-railed **`sre` operator role** for infrastructure-grade actions — not
just conceptual or UI-only separation.

**BR-09 — Enable continuous GitOps-based reproducibility**  
The entire environment must be **teardown-and-redeploy reproducible from
Git** — including data plane, control plane, SQL AG topology, and Grafana
telemetry contracts.

**BR-10 — Demonstrate SLO-ready reliability metrics**  
The platform must produce **immediately usable SLI signals** for
availability, latency, and failure rate — enabling SLO definition without
friction or redesign.

**BR-11 — Demonstrate controlled chaos & failure injection readiness**  
The platform must support **intentional failure injection (e.g. pod kill, DB
failover, latency spikes)** as a **first-class capability**, not a bolt-on,
to prove active reliability engineering readiness.

**BR-12 — Must enable measurable operator learning & hiring assessment**  
The platform must allow **recruiters, mentors, or SRE leads** to clearly
observe behaviors such as **debug skill, trace correlation, failure
analysis**, and **system recovery reasoning** — not just view static
dashboards.

**BR-13 — Support observability-driven debugging, not log scraping**  
The platform must enable engineers to **start from a symptom (e.g. latency
spike)** and navigate **trace → log → metric → root cause** without guesswork
— proving observability is engineered, not decorative.

**BR-14 — Prove event-driven consistency and traceable data flow**  
All state changes must emit **domain events**, enabling downstream systems or
analytics to **process changes deterministically** — demonstrating readiness
for a **future event-driven ecosystem**.

**BR-15 — Must teach failure visibility, not hide it**  
System must **surface and preserve evidence** of failures (e.g. stuck
commands, slow replication, failed shard routing) for **post-incident
analysis**, not silently auto-resolve or discard failure signals.

**BR-16 — Must be educationally narratable end-to-end**  
The platform must be structured so that **a human or AI can tell the story
of how a request flows through the system** — from API to shard to
observability to audit trail — making it usable as a teaching, documentation,
or portfolio artifact.
