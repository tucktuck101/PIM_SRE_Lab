# Storage_Topology Applicable Requirements

This note summarizes the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that impact the storage topology. Use it when designing or reviewing storage tiers, replication, backup/restore, resilience, and compliance.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — All business drivers influence how storage tiers support realistic workloads, data safety, scalability, compliance, observability, failure visibility, and educational narrative.

## Functional Requirements (Storage-Focused Highlights)
- Core FRs that mention storage, persistence, data handling, event flow, and operational resilience. This includes FR-01.x (data generation), FR-02.x (data handling), FR-03.x (scalability), FR-04.x (routing/locality), FR-05.x (resilience), FR-06.x (observability), FR-07.x (audit/temporal history), FR-08.x (roles), FR-09.x (infra/GitOps), FR-14.x (event consistency), FR-15.x (failure evidence), FR-16.x (lineage/narratives), FR-X.x (cross-cutting defaults), FR-17.x (retention), FR-18.x (controlled operations).

## Non-Functional Requirements (Storage/Infra Highlights)
- NFRs around availability, durability, latency, backpressure, security, observability, infrastructure, backup/recovery, and chaos guardrails (NFR-01 through NFR-37). Emphasis on availability (NFR-01), durability (NFR-05), latency (NFR-06/07/08), queue processing (NFR-10), concurrency (NFR-11), autoscaling (NFR-13), backpressure (NFR-14), authentication/authorization/secrets (NFR-15/16/17), data minimization (NFR-18), audit retention (NFR-19), observability (NFR-20+), storage specifics (NFR-27), GitOps (NFR-28), backup/restore (NFR-29/30), runbooks (NFR-31), resource efficiency (NFR-32), DR/chaos requirements (NFR-33–35), golden path and self-documenting observability (NFR-36/37).
