# Availability_DR_Topology Applicable Requirements

Reference this note when building the Availability & Disaster Recovery Topology documentation. It distills the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that the topology must satisfy across redundancy, failover, recovery objectives, and operational readiness.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — The DR strategy must serve realistic healthcare workloads (BR-01), operate with synthetic-yet-production-like data (BR-02), scale via configuration (BR-03), respect shard-based locality (BR-04), prove self-healing and resilience (BR-05), preserve full observability (BR-06), enforce auditable control (BR-07), uphold security boundaries (BR-08), support GitOps reproducibility (BR-09), enable SLO-ready metrics (BR-10), facilitate chaos experimentation (BR-11), teach operators (BR-12), enable observability-driven debugging (BR-13), maintain event consistency (BR-14), capture failure evidence (BR-15), and remain narratable for education (BR-16).

## Functional Requirements (Availability/DR-Focused Highlights)
- **FR-03.x** — Horizontal scaling, sharding, and configuration externalization define redundancy patterns and how quickly capacity can be restored.
- **FR-04.x** — Shard-aware routing and listener health checks guide failover routing logic.
- **FR-05.x** — Explicit resilience capabilities (pod loss tolerance, automatic failover, retry logic, chaos interfaces) are core DR patterns to document and validate.
- **FR-06.x** — MELTP observability ensures DR events are visible and verifiable during recovery drills.
- **FR-07.x** — Audit history, temporal tables, and event logs must persist across failover and recovery.
- **FR-08.x** — Role-specific privileges and secure access boundaries govern who can trigger DR actions.
- **FR-09.x** — GitOps pipelines dictate how infrastructure and DR runbooks are versioned and restored.
- **FR-10.x** — SLO-ready metrics inform recovery time objectives (RTO) and error budget policy during DR states.
- **FR-11.x** — Chaos and failure mode exercises supply required scenarios to prove DR readiness.
- **FR-13.x / FR-15.x / FR-16.x** — Debugging, failure evidence, and end-to-end journey documentation ensure DR narratives capture root causes and lessons learned.
- **FR-17.x / FR-18.x / FR-X.x** — Retention, archival, data handling, and guardrails impact backup strategies and compliance for DR replicas.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Availability/DR-Focused Highlights)
- **NFR-01 through NFR-37** — Availability, latency, durability, security, compliance, deployment, storage, recovery, efficiency, chaos guardrails, and observability automation define the topology’s success metrics. Pay particular attention to NFR-01–NFR-08 (availability/latency objectives), NFR-11–NFR-20 (deployment, configuration, and safe rollout), NFR-21–NFR-27 (backup/restore, retention, encryption), and NFR-32–NFR-37 (controlled chaos, automated documentation). Ensure DR plans achieve stated RPO/RTO targets and integrate with the observability and GitOps ecosystems.
