# SLI_SLO_Measurement_Plan Applicable Requirements

Use this note to compile the requirements context while authoring the SLI/SLO Measurement Plan. It highlights which business, functional, and non-functional requirements must shape indicator selection, target setting, alerting policy, and review cadence.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — All business drivers inform how reliability signals are curated: realistic workload coverage (BR-01), safe-but-production-like data (BR-02), configuration-driven scalability (BR-03), shard-aware routing (BR-04), failure resilience demonstrations (BR-05), observability maturity (BR-06), auditable accountability (BR-07), secure role boundaries (BR-08), GitOps reproducibility (BR-09), SLO-ready metrics (BR-10), chaos experimentation (BR-11), operator enablement (BR-12), observability-driven debugging (BR-13), event consistency (BR-14), failure evidence (BR-15), and narratable stories (BR-16). Each driver should map to signals, burn rates, and error budgets captured in the plan.

## Functional Requirements (Reliability-Focused Highlights)
- **FR-03.x** — Stateless scaling and infrastructure elasticity determine capacity-based SLIs.
- **FR-05.x** — Failure handling, retries, and chaos interfaces supply scenarios for measuring steady-state vs. degraded performance.
- **FR-06.x** — MELTP observability coverage defines mandatory signals, labels, and propagation rules the plan must catalogue.
- **FR-07.x** — Audit trails ensure measurement accountability and traceability for SLO breaches.
- **FR-09.x** — GitOps workflows dictate how SLI/SLO definitions are versioned and deployed.
- **FR-10.x** — Explicitly requires SLO-ready metrics, burn-rate alerts, and golden signals.
- **FR-11.x** — Chaos experiments must feed validation scenarios into the measurement plan.
- **FR-13.x / FR-15.x / FR-16.x** — Troubleshooting narratives, failure evidence, and end-to-end journey documentation inform which user journeys become composite SLIs.
- **FR-17.x / FR-18.x / FR-X.x** — Retention, data lifecycle, and guardrail constraints influence how long SLO history is stored and when alerts escalate.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Reliability-Focused Highlights)
- **NFR-01 through NFR-37** — Availability, latency, throughput, security, resilience, deployment, storage, disaster recovery, efficiency, chaos guardrails, and observability automation all dictate targets. Pay particular attention to NFR-01–NFR-08 (core SLO envelopes), NFR-11–NFR-18 (deployment/release quality), NFR-21–NFR-27 (data protection and recovery), and NFR-32–NFR-37 (chaos, self-documenting observability, operational defaults). Ensure every SLI/SLO definition and review process aligns with these constraints.
