# C4_L1_System_Context Applicable Requirements

This note captures the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that describe the C4 Level 1 system boundary, actors, and expectations. Use it while producing or reviewing the L1 context diagram.`

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01**: Demonstrate realistic national-scale healthcare workload simulation so the platform exercises SRE patterns under realistic load.
- **BR-02**: Prove the platform operates safely without real PHI by using synthetic, pseudonymized data that behaves like production data.
- **BR-03**: Prove horizontal scalability without redesign by scaling from single-node to multi-node Kubernetes via configuration only.
- **BR-04**: Demonstrate shard-based routing and locality enforcement driven by patient identity.
- **BR-05**: Demonstrate provable failure resilience and self-healing during arbitrary pod or replica failures.
- **BR-06**: Demonstrate full observability maturity (MELTP) with zero orphan execution and Grafana visualization.
- **BR-07**: Prove auditable accountability for every state change tied to user and request identifiers.
- **BR-08**: Demonstrate multi-role security boundaries including patient, clinician, admin, and SRE operator roles.
- **BR-09**: Enable continuous GitOps-based reproducibility of the entire environment from source control.
- **BR-10**: Demonstrate SLO-ready reliability metrics to enable immediate SLO definitions.
- **BR-11**: Demonstrate controlled chaos and failure injection readiness as a first-class capability.
- **BR-12**: Enable measurable operator learning and assessment through observable behaviors.
- **BR-13**: Support observability-driven debugging that correlates traces, logs, and metrics to root cause.
- **BR-14**: Prove event-driven consistency and traceable data flow via domain events.
- **BR-15**: Teach failure visibility by surfacing and preserving evidence of failures.
- **BR-16**: Make the system educationally narratable end-to-end for humans and AI.
