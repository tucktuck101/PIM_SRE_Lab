# Release_Strategy Applicable Requirements

Use this note to anchor the requirements context while defining the Release Strategy. It summarizes the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that guide branching, approvals, deployment automation, rollout safety, and observability of releases.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — The release approach must sustain realistic workloads (BR-01), maintain safety with synthetic data (BR-02), enable configuration-driven scalability (BR-03), respect shard locality (BR-04), demonstrate resilient rollouts (BR-05), preserve observability coverage (BR-06), ensure auditable change trails (BR-07), uphold role boundaries (BR-08), integrate with GitOps reproducibility (BR-09), expose SLO-ready metrics (BR-10), support chaos and failover drills (BR-11), train operators (BR-12), aid debugging narratives (BR-13), protect event consistency (BR-14), capture failure evidence (BR-15), and remain narratable for education (BR-16).

## Functional Requirements (Release-Focused Highlights)
- **FR-03.x** — Stateless scaling and configuration externalization drive blue/green, canary, and rollback capabilities.
- **FR-04.x** — Shard-aware routing impacts phased rollouts and target selection.
- **FR-05.x** — Resilience behaviors and chaos interfaces specify how releases must tolerate component failures.
- **FR-06.x** — MELTP observability coverage requires every release to update dashboards, alerts, and annotations.
- **FR-07.x** — Audit and temporal history guarantee traceability for release decisions.
- **FR-08.x** — Role-based access controls define approval chains and deployment privileges.
- **FR-09.x** — GitOps flows dictate branch strategy, pipelines, policy enforcement, and change reconciliation.
- **FR-10.x** — SLO-readiness informs release gates, burn-rate monitoring, and error budget policies.
- **FR-11.x** — Chaos experimentation ties into release validation and post-deploy verification.
- **FR-13.x / FR-15.x / FR-16.x** — Troubleshooting, failure evidence, and narrative documentation shape release runbooks and retrospectives.
- **FR-17.x / FR-18.x / FR-X.x** — Retention, archival, and guardrails influence artifact storage, release notes, and compliance evidence.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Release-Focused Highlights)
- **NFR-01 through NFR-37** — Availability, latency, security, deployment rigor, storage, recovery, efficiency, chaos governance, and observability automation guide release cadences, freeze windows, rollback strategies, and compliance obligations. Prioritize NFR-11–NFR-20 (deployment quality, safe rollouts), NFR-21–NFR-27 (backup/restore, retention), and NFR-32–NFR-37 (controlled chaos, self-documenting telemetry). Ensure release planning aligns with these constraints and codifies required validation steps.
