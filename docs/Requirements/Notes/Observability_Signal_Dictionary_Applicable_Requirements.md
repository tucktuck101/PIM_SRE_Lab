# Observability_Signal_Dictionary Applicable Requirements

This note summarizes the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that govern the observability signal dictionary. Use it while defining metrics, logs, traces, profiles, owners, dashboards, and alert policies.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — Capture how business drivers shape telemetry expectations: realistic workloads, synthetic data safety, scalability, observability depth, resilience, auditability, role boundaries, GitOps reproducibility, chaos readiness, operator learning, debugging, event consistency, failure visibility, and narratability.

## Functional Requirements (Observability-Focused Highlights)
- FR-01.x to FR-16.x plus cross-cutting FR-X, FR-17.x, and FR-18.x — Pay particular attention to FR-06.x (observability signals), FR-07.x (audit history), FR-10.x (SLO-ready signals), FR-11.x (chaos annotation), FR-13.x (debugging drill-down), FR-15.x (failure evidence), FR-16.x (request journey/documentation), and any others specifying telemetry references, sample payloads, or narratives.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Observability-Focused Highlights)
- NFR-01 through NFR-37 — Focus on availability, latency, security, observability pipelines, deployment, storage, backup/restore, efficiency, chaos guardrails, and self-documenting observability. These define retention, alerting burn rates, dashboard performance, profiling cadence, and compliance requirements.
