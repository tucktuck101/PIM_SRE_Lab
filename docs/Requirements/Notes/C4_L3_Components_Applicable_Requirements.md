# C4_L3_Components Applicable Requirements

This note captures the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that drive the C4 Level 3 (Component) architecture. Use it while designing, reviewing, and validating component responsibilities and interactions.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01**: Demonstrate realistic national-scale healthcare workload simulation so the platform exercises SRE patterns under realistic load.
- **BR-02**: Prove the platform operates safely without real PHI by using synthetic, pseudonymized data that behaves like production data.
- **BR-03**: Prove horizontal scalability without redesign by scaling from single-node to multi-node Kubernetes via configuration only.
- **BR-04**: Demonstrate shard-based routing and locality enforcement driven by patient identity.
- **BR-05**: Demonstrate provable failure resilience and self-healing during arbitrary pod or replica failures.
- **BR-06**: Demonstrate full observability maturity (MELTP) with zero orphan execution and Grafana visualization.
- **BR-07**: Prove auditable accountability for every state change tied to user and request identifiers.
- **BR-08**: Demonstrate multi-role security boundaries including patient, clinician, admin, and SRE operator roles.
- **BR-09**: Enable continuous GitOps-based reproducibility of the entire environment from source control.
- **BR-10**: Demonstrate SLO-ready reliability metrics to enable immediate SLO definitions.
- **BR-11**: Demonstrate controlled chaos and failure injection readiness as a first-class capability.
- **BR-12**: Enable measurable operator learning and assessment through observable behaviors.
- **BR-13**: Support observability-driven debugging that correlates traces, logs, and metrics to root cause.
- **BR-14**: Prove event-driven consistency and traceable data flow via domain events.
- **BR-15**: Teach failure visibility by surfacing and preserving evidence of failures.
- **BR-16**: Make the system educationally narratable end-to-end for humans and AI.

## Functional Requirements (Component-Relevant)
- **FR-01.1** to **FR-01.5**: Seed data generation, multi-profile load simulation, role-specific mixes, traffic presets, and configurable profiles that drive component workloads.
- **FR-02.1** to **FR-02.4**: Synthetic data handling, schema constraints, masking, and redaction requirements that affect component interfaces.
- **FR-03.1** to **FR-03.4**: Stateless APIs, sharding, configuration externalization, and idempotent writes for reliable component scaling.
- **FR-04.1** to **FR-04.4**: Deterministic routing, shard map hot updates, read/write routing, and health endpoints for component coordination.
- **FR-05.1** to **FR-05.5**: Failure resilience, failover behavior, retries, chaos tooling, and observability integration.
- **FR-06.1** to **FR-06.5**: Tracing, structured logging, metrics, profiling, and telemetry coverage expectations.
- **FR-07.1** to **FR-07.4**: Audit, temporal history, queryability, and context requirements for component changes.
- **FR-08.1** to **FR-08.4**: Role enforcement, RLS, guarded admin operations, and session context handling.
- **FR-09.1** to **FR-09.4**: GitOps alignment, reproducible builds, migration discipline, and deterministic seed data.
- **FR-10.1** to **FR-10.3**: Golden signals, SLO rollups, and alerting tied to containers/components.
- **FR-11.1** to **FR-11.3**: Chaos interface, observability annotations, and audit logging for component-level experiments.
- **FR-12.1** to **FR-12.3**: Guided debugging scenarios, reviewer checklists, and operator performance metrics.
- **FR-13.1** to **FR-13.3**: Grafana drill-downs, trace/audit links, and DB slow query spans relevant to components.
- **FR-14.1** to **FR-14.3**: Outbox pattern, CDC projections, and event schema management.
- **FR-15.1** to **FR-15.3**: Failure evidence persistence, backlog dashboards, and dead-letter handling.
- **FR-16.1** to **FR-16.4**: Request journey, data lineage, documentation narratives, and glossary consistency.
- **FR-X.1** to **FR-X.6**: API versioning, idempotency, error structure, configuration defaults, time handling, and referential integrity.
- **FR-17.1**, **FR-17.2**: Data retention and purging/archiving policies.
- **FR-18.1**, **FR-18.2**: Guarded destructive operations and dry-run modes for migrations, shard adjustments, and chaos rollout.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Component-Relevant)
- **NFR-01** to **NFR-05**: Availability, failover continuity, pod survivability, error budget cadence, and data durability.
- **NFR-06** to **NFR-10**: Latency targets and queue processing expectations.
- **NFR-11** to **NFR-14**: Concurrency, shard capacity, autoscaling behavior, and backpressure handling.
- **NFR-15** to **NFR-19**: Authentication, authorization, secrets management, data minimization, and audit retention.
- **NFR-20** to **NFR-24**: Observability coverage, logging structure, metric cardinality, profiling, and dashboard performance.
- **NFR-25** to **NFR-28**: Zero-downtime deploys, SQL AG topology, storage requirements, and GitOps drift detection.
- **NFR-29** to **NFR-31**: Backup cadence, RPO/RTO targets, and runbook linkage.
- **NFR-32** to **NFR-33**: Efficiency SLIs and idle scaling policies.
- **NFR-34** to **NFR-35**: Chaos guardrails and post-experiment hygiene.
- **NFR-36**, **NFR-37**: Golden path workflows and self-documenting observability artifacts.
