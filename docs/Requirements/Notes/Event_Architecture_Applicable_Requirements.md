# Event_Architecture Applicable Requirements

This note summarizes the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that drive the event architecture. Use it while drafting or reviewing event flows, topics, schemas, and integration patterns.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — All business drivers influence event design: realistic workloads, data safety, scalability, observability, resilience, auditability, consistency, failure visibility, and educational narrative.

## Functional Requirements (Event-Focused Highlights)
- FR-01.x to FR-16.x & cross-cutting FR-X, FR-17.x, FR-18.x — Pay special attention to FR-02.x (data handling), FR-03.x (scalability), FR-05.x (resilience), FR-06.x (observability), FR-07.x (audit history), FR-09.x (GitOps/infra), FR-10.x (SLO signals), FR-11.x (chaos), FR-14.x (event consistency), FR-15.x (failure evidence), FR-16.x (narratives/lineage), and the FR-X cross-cutting defaults.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Event-Focused Highlights)
- NFR-01 through NFR-37 — Prioritize availability, durability, latency, backpressure, security, observability, deployment, storage/backup, efficiency, chaos guardrails, and self-documenting observability when shaping event pipelines.
