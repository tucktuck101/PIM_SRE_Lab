# Kubernetes_Topology Applicable Requirements

Use this note to anchor the requirements context while documenting the Kubernetes Topology. It distills the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that influence cluster layout, workloads, routing, resilience, and operational safeguards.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** — The topology must sustain realistic healthcare simulations (BR-01), run on safe synthetic data (BR-02), scale through configuration (BR-03), enforce shard-based locality (BR-04), demonstrate fault tolerance (BR-05), maintain observability depth (BR-06), preserve auditable history (BR-07), uphold security boundaries (BR-08), enable GitOps reproducibility (BR-09), surface SLO-ready metrics (BR-10), support chaos experimentation (BR-11), enable operator learning (BR-12), facilitate debugging narratives (BR-13), maintain event consistency (BR-14), capture failure evidence (BR-15), and remain narratable for education (BR-16).

## Functional Requirements (Kubernetes-Focused Highlights)
- **FR-01.x / FR-02.x** — Synthetic data generation and role-based traffic mixes drive workload sizing, namespaces, and resource quotas.
- **FR-03.x** — Stateless services, sharding, configuration externalization, and horizontal scaling describe deployment patterns, HPA/VPA policies, and cluster autoscaling.
- **FR-04.x** — Shard routing and deterministic request placement guide service mesh, ingress, and DNS configurations.
- **FR-05.x** — Resilience, failover, retries, and chaos interfaces dictate pod disruption budgets, readiness checks, and multi-zone placement.
- **FR-06.x** — MELTP observability requires consistent labeling, sidecars/agents, and telemetry pipelines across namespaces.
- **FR-07.x** — Audit and temporal history requirements inform logging, immutability, and storage classes.
- **FR-08.x** — Role boundaries translate into namespace isolation, RBAC, network policies, and secret management.
- **FR-09.x** — GitOps mandates declarative manifests, drift detection, and flux/Argo practices.
- **FR-10.x** — SLO readiness shapes monitoring attachments, alerts, and golden-signal dashboards.
- **FR-11.x** — Chaos controls map to tooling (Litmus, Gremlin) and guardrails for experiments.
- **FR-13.x / FR-15.x / FR-16.x** — Troubleshooting and narrative requirements guide logging retention, trace sampling, and topology diagrams.
- **FR-17.x / FR-18.x / FR-X.x** — Retention, archival, and guardrails influence storage classes, backup jobs, and compliance boundaries.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Kubernetes-Focused Highlights)
- **NFR-01 through NFR-37** — Availability, latency, security, deployment, storage, backup/restore, efficiency, chaos governance, and observability automation govern cluster sizing, region/zone strategy, runtime hardening, and operational defaults. Emphasize NFR-01–NFR-08 (availability/latency envelopes), NFR-11–NFR-20 (deployment discipline, change safety), NFR-21–NFR-27 (data protection, recovery), and NFR-32–NFR-37 (chaos policies, self-documenting telemetry). Ensure the topology plan aligns with these constraints and documents how compliance is achieved.
