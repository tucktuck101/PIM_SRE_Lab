# Domain_Context_Map Applicable Requirements

This note captures the business, functional, and non-functional requirements that influence the Domain Context Map. Use it when identifying bounded contexts, relationships, and integration strategies.

## Business Requirements
- **BR-01** through **BR-16** â€” All business drivers that define system capabilities, data sensitivity, scalability, operability, compliance, and traceability constraints. These shape the contexts, their boundaries, and collaboration.

## Functional Requirements (Context-Focused Highlights)
- All relevant FRs from the requirements catalog impacting domain modeling, event flow, auditing, and observability. In particular: FR-01.x (workload simulation), FR-02.x (data handling), FR-03.x (scalability), FR-04.x (routing/locality), FR-05.x (resilience), FR-06.x (observability), FR-07.x (audit/temporal), FR-08.x (roles), FR-09.x (GitOps/infra), FR-10.x (SLO signals), FR-11.x (chaos), FR-12.x (operational scenarios), FR-13.x (debug paths), FR-14.x (event consistency), FR-15.x (failure visibility), FR-16.x (narratability), FR-X.x (cross-cutting defaults), FR-17.x (retention), FR-18.x (guarded operations).

## Non-Functional Requirements (Context-Focused Highlights)
- Relevant NFRs covering availability, scalability, security, observability, DR, testing, and compliance (NFR-01 through NFR-37). These requirements guide context boundaries, integration guardrails, and operational expectations.
