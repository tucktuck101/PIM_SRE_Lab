# Domain Context Overview

> Summarize the business domain, the scope of this context map, and key
> objectives. Mention any relevant requirements driving the domain design.

## Context Map Diagram

> Embed or link the domain context map (PNG/SVG/Mermaid). Include the source
> file path for regeneration.

## Bounded Contexts

| Context | Responsibilities | Key Consumers | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Describe the context’s purpose | Who consumes its outputs | Ownership, constraints, etc. |

> Add rows for each bounded context in scope.

## Context Relationships

| Relationship | Description | Pattern | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Explain the relationship (upstream/downstream) | e.g., Published Language, Canonical Model | Describe API, event, integration |

> Capture upstream/downstream interactions, translation layers, and shared
> models.

## Anti-Corruption and Integration Layers

> Document anti-corruption layers, translation services, or integration
> strategies needed to isolate bounded contexts.

## Domain Events and Shared Concepts

> List key domain events, shared vocab, or ubiquitous language elements
> that cross context boundaries.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Identify risks, assumptions, or unresolved domain modeling questions.
> Assign owners and follow-up actions where applicable.

## References

> Link to supporting documents: requirements, design docs, event catalogs,
> glossary entries, ADRs, etc.
