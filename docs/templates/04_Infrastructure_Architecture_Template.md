# Overview

> Summarize the overall infrastructure architecture, including the primary
> workloads, platform boundaries, and design intent. Keep this to two or
> three paragraphs so readers understand scope quickly.

## Objectives

> List the key goals the infrastructure architecture must satisfy (e.g.,
> availability, portability, regulatory requirements). Tie these objectives
> back to BR/FR/NFR IDs where possible.

## Scope and Assumptions

> Describe what is included in this architecture document, the systems or
> environments covered, and the assumptions being made. Call out anything
> explicitly out of scope.

## Environment Topology

> Provide a high-level topology diagram (link to source) showing regions,
> clusters, networks, and major services. Summarize the topology in text so
> readers understand the deployment model.

## Platform Services

> Detail the shared services (e.g., compute, storage, messaging, observability)
> and how they are provisioned. Include owners, SLAs/SLOs, and integration
> points for each service.

## Networking and Access Control

> Explain network segmentation, connectivity between environments, ingress/
> egress patterns, and identity/access control layers (IAM, RBAC, secrets
> management).

## Security and Compliance

> Document security controls, encryption, compliance requirements (HIPAA,
> SOC 2, etc.), and how infrastructure enforces them. Reference relevant NFRs
> and policies.

## Reliability, Availability, and DR

> Describe redundancy, failover patterns, backup/restore strategies, RPO/RTO
> targets, and how disaster recovery is orchestrated. Reference supporting
> runbooks or drills.

## Capacity and Cost Modeling

> Outline capacity assumptions, growth projections, autoscaling policies, and
> cost management strategies. Note any tooling used for forecasting.

## Operations and Tooling

> Enumerate the operational toolchain (e.g., infra-as-code, CI/CD, monitoring,
> alerting, incident response), including ownership and integration points.

## Risks and Mitigations

> List key infrastructure risks, their impact, and planned mitigations.
> Include technical, compliance, and operational risks.

## Open Questions

> Capture unresolved decisions or dependencies that require follow-up,
> along with owners and due dates.

## References

> Link to supporting documents: design docs, diagrams, runbooks, ADRs,
> RFCs, and external specifications.
