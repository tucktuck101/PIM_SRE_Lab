# Event Architecture Overview

> Provide a high-level narrative describing the event-driven aspects of the
> system, the goals, and how they align with business requirements.

## Event Topology Diagram

> Embed or link the event flow diagram (PNG/SVG/Mermaid). Include the source
> path so reviewers can regenerate it.

## Event Catalog

| Event | Purpose | Schema Reference | Producers | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Describe why this event exists | Link to schema | List producers | List consumers |

> Add rows for each significant domain event or integration event.

## Channels and Delivery

> Document the transport channels (topics, queues, streams), delivery
> semantics (at-most, at-least once), and retention policies.

## Ordering, Idempotency, and Error Handling

> Describe ordering guarantees, idempotency strategies, deduplication, DLQs,
> retry policies, and failure handling for the event flows.

## Security and Compliance

> Summarize event payload security, PII/PHI considerations, encryption,
> access control, and compliance requirements for event pipelines.

## Observability and Monitoring

> Outline metrics, logs, traces, alerting, and dashboards used to monitor
> event health and throughput.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Capture known risks, trade-offs, or unresolved design questions for the
> event architecture. Assign owners and follow-ups.

## References

> Link to supporting documents: schema registries, design docs, ADRs,
> requirements, contracts with external partners, etc.
