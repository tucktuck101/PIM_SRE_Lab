# Container Overview

> Provide a brief narrative describing the overall container architecture,
> highlighting the major services, their responsibilities, and how they
> collaborate within the system boundary.

## Container Diagram

> Embed or link the C4 Level 2 container diagram (PNG/SVG/Mermaid). Include
> the source path so reviewers can regenerate it.

## Container Catalog

| Container | Purpose / Responsibilities | Technology Stack | Interfaces / APIs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Describe core responsibilities | e.g., Node.js, Postgres | Summarize inbound/outbound interfaces |

> Expand the table for each container/service. Capture ownership if helpful.

## Deployment / Runtime Considerations

> Describe how containers are deployed (clusters, environments, scaling,
> failover) and any runtime nuances (e.g., schedulers, orchestrators,
> configuration sources).

## Data and State Considerations

> Summarize how each container manages data, state, caching, and storage
> dependencies. Reference data stores or shared services where relevant.

## Security and Compliance

> Highlight authentication, authorization, secrets management, network
> boundaries, and compliance constraints for each container or integration.

## Observability and Operations

> Document logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting expectations for each
> container. Note runbooks or operational playbooks if they exist.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Capture known risks, trade-offs, and open questions related to container
> design. Assign owners and next steps if possible.

## References

> Link to supporting documents: requirements, design docs, runbooks,
> diagrams, ADRs, RFCs, etc.
