# Storage Topology Overview

> Summarize the storage landscape: major data stores, their roles, and the
> business goals they support (e.g., OLTP vs OLAP, compliance needs).

## Topology Diagram

> Embed or link the storage topology diagram (PNG/SVG/Mermaid). Include the
> source path so reviewers can regenerate it.

## Storage Components

| Store / Service | Purpose | Data Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Describe role | e.g., PHI, PII, public | Include ownership, SLAs, constraints |

> Add rows for each database, data lake, cache, queue, or storage service.

## Replication, Backup, and DR

> Detail replication strategies, backup schedules, DR plans, and RPO/RTO
> targets for each storage component.

## Capacity and Performance

> Document throughput, latency expectations, sizing assumptions, and
> autoscaling/partitioning approaches.

## Security and Compliance

> Describe encryption (at rest/in transit), access controls, auditing,
> compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.), and how they are enforced.

## Operations and Monitoring

> Outline operational tooling, monitoring/alerting, runbooks, and ownership
> for storage operations.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Capture known risks, technical debt, or unanswered questions regarding
> storage topology. Assign owners where possible.

## References

> Link to supporting documents: requirements, design docs, runbooks,
> DR playbooks, observability dashboards, ADRs, etc.
