# Domain Model Overview

> Provide a short narrative introducing the domain model, its scope, and
> the business goals it supports. Highlight any key requirements driving
> this model.

## UML Diagram

> Embed or link the UML class diagram (PNG/SVG/Mermaid). Include the source
> path so reviewers can regenerate it.

## Entity Catalog

| Entity | Description | Key Attributes | Relationships |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Summarize entity purpose | List primary attributes | Describe associations |

> Add rows for each significant entity in the domain. Include ownership or
> constraints where relevant.

## Aggregates and Value Objects

> Document aggregate roots, value objects, invariants, and consistency
> boundaries. Reference relevant domain services or factories.

## State, Lifecycle, and Transitions

> Explain important state transitions, lifecycle phases, and any domain
> rules that govern them. Reference sequence diagrams or events if helpful.

## Integration and Mapping

> Describe how domain entities map to persistence models, external APIs, or
> other contexts. Note translation layers or DTOs as needed.

## Constraints and Invariants

> Capture business rules, validation constraints, or invariants that must
> hold across the domain model.

## Risks and Open Questions

> List known risks, modeling trade-offs, or open issues requiring follow-up.
> Assign owners where applicable.

## References

> Link to supporting docs: requirements, domain event catalogs, glossary,
> design docs, ADRs, etc.
