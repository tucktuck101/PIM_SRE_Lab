# Component Overview

> Describe the scope of this C4 Level 3 view: which container it zooms into,
> what components are shown, and the primary responsibilities being modeled.

## Component Diagram

> Embed or link the C4 Level 3 component diagram (PNG/SVG/Mermaid). Include
> the source path so reviewers can regenerate it.

## Component Catalog

| Component | Responsibilities | Key Interfaces | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Describe the component’s duties | Summarize inbound/outbound calls | Add ownership, constraints, etc. |

> Add rows for each internal component. Note cross-container calls or shared
> libraries as needed.

## Collaboration and Flows

> Explain how components collaborate to fulfill major workflows. Reference
> sequence diagrams or runtime traces where helpful.

## Data and State Handling

> Document how components manage state, persistence, caching, and external
> data dependencies.

## Security and Compliance

> Highlight any in-component security/auth concerns, data classification, and
> compliance requirements relevant at the component level.

## Testing and Observability

> Call out key unit/integration testing approaches, harnesses, telemetry, and
> alerting expectations for each component.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Capture known risks, assumptions, or unanswered questions about the
> component design. Assign owners where possible.

## References

> Link to related docs: higher-level C4 diagrams, design docs, ADRs,
> requirements, sequence diagrams, etc.
