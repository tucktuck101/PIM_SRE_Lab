# System Context

> Provide a short narrative that explains the overall system boundary,
> primary actors, and why this context diagram matters. Keep it to a few
> paragraphs focusing on business capability and scope.

## Diagram

> Embed or link the C4 Level 1 System Context diagram (PNG/SVG/Mermaid).
> Include the source path so reviewers can regenerate it.

## Actors

| Actor | Description | Interaction Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | Describe the actor | Explain how the actor interacts with the system |

> Expand the table for each external person, system, or service that
> interacts with this system boundary.

## System Responsibilities

> Summarize what the system is responsible for and, just as important,
> what it is **not** responsible for. Tie statements to specific
> requirements where relevant (BR/FR/NFR IDs).

## External Dependencies

> List external systems or services this system depends on. Describe the
> nature of each dependency, protocols used, and any key contracts or SLAs.

## Security and Compliance Considerations

> Highlight authentication, authorization, audit, and compliance concerns
> that influence the system boundary. Note how sensitive data is handled.

## Operational Concerns

> Call out deployment environments, monitoring hooks, alert ownership, and
> any operational constraints that impact the system context.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Document known risks or unresolved questions related to system scope,
> actor interactions, or dependencies. Assign owners where possible.

## References

> Link to supporting documentation (business requirements, design docs,
> diagrams, ADRs, external specifications, etc.).
