# Purpose
> Summarize the business or technical problem this design solves. Keep it under three sentences.

## Scope and Non-Goals
> Bullet the capabilities in scope and explicitly state non-goals to prevent scope creep.

## Context and Constraints
> Describe the current state, dependencies, and constraints (regulatory, technical, operational).

## Architecture Overview
> Provide a narrative of the end-to-end architecture. Reference diagrams or embed Mermaid diagrams when possible.

## Components
> Detail each major component, ownership, and responsibilities. Highlight new or modified services.

## Interfaces and Contracts
> List APIs, events, schemas, and contract changes. Clarify versioning and compatibility expectations.

## Data Model
> Describe new or updated data models, including storage considerations and entity relationships.

## Security and Privacy
> Identify security controls, authn/authz flows, data classification, and privacy implications.

## Reliability and Observability
> Outline SLOs, SLIs, alerting strategy, telemetry coverage, and how the design maintains reliability targets.

## Capacity and Performance
> Document scaling assumptions, capacity planning inputs, and performance targets or benchmarks.

## Failure Modes and Risks
> Enumerate risks, failure scenarios, blast radius, and mitigations including rollback paths.

## Alternatives
> Summarize alternative options considered and why they were rejected.

## Decision and Rationale
> State the selected approach and the key reasons it was chosen.

## Rollout and Operations
> Explain rollout phases, migration steps, operational ownership, and on-call readiness activities.

## Testing and Verification
> Specify test strategies (unit, integration, chaos, load) and acceptance criteria before launch.

## Open Questions
> Capture unresolved items requiring follow-up or additional research.

## Appendix
> Include supplementary materials: detailed diagrams, capacity math, glossary additions, or reference links.
