# Observability Signal Overview

> Introduce the scope and purpose of this observability signal dictionary,
> including systems covered and how engineers should use it.

## Signal Catalog

| Signal Name | Type (Metric/Log/Trace/Profile) | Description | Source | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | e.g., Metric | Summarize intent | e.g., Prometheus | Team/Owner | Include SLO/SLA ties |

> Add rows for each observability signal. Expand the table as needed.

## Collection and Instrumentation

> Describe how signals are instrumented, collected, and exported (agents,
> libraries, pipelines). Note any sampling strategies or latency.

## Dashboards and Alerts

> Document dashboards, alert rules, burn rate monitors, and who receives
> them. Reference SLOs or runbooks where applicable.

## Retention and Compliance

> Outline data retention policies, compliance considerations, and masking/
> scrubbing requirements for observability data.

## Testing and Validation

> Explain how observability pipelines are tested (synthetic checks, data
> quality tests, regression testing) and how issues are detected.

## Risks and Open Questions

> Capture known risks, missing signals, or follow-up actions. Assign owners
> and next steps where possible.

## References

> Link to supporting documents: instrumentation guides, dashboards,
> runbooks, SLI/SLO plans, ADRs, etc.
